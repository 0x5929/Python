Unvalidated redirects and forwards
Web applications frequently redirect users to other pages or external websites. We have to validate the credibility of those redirected pages and websites. If the redirect target is passed as a parameter to the application, an attacker can lead the user to any phishing or malware-injected web page. We can write a Python script to validate all external links in the application. To validate the credibility, we can depend on any third-party service like Google Safe Browsing checker or site advisor from McAfee.
