#!/usr/bin/python

## ^ above states the location of the python program
## and states the intepreter we need to use for the script 
## and once we make the python file an executable using chmod cmd
## we are able to run the script
## the first line could have also been #!/home/kevin/Python/Lesson-1/Python2.7/bin/python2.7
## that would be used for a virutal env in python to seperate it from other python versions


print "Hello World from python2.7!"
